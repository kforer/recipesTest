Yukon Gold Potato Soup (No Bacon!)

Potato Soup made with buttery yukon gold potatoes tastes like a hearty potato chowder! This is a no bacon, no cheese potato soup – the milk makes it creamy enough! My kids love this soup so much they always ask for another bowl!

Ingredients
7 cups Yukon potatoes diced
3 stalks celery diced
1/2 cup onion finely chopped
5 cups chicken broth divided
4 cups milk
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons butter melted
2 cups corn fresh, frozen or canned
4 chicken bouillon cubes
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon pepper

Instructions

Add potatoes, celery, onion and 2 cups of chicken broth into a large soup pot. Bring to a boil and continue cooking until potatoes are tender and a fork easily slides in, about 15 minutes. Drain the vegetables, KEEPING ALL THE BROTH THAT’S LEFT in the pot.

In the same pot that has the broth in it, add milk, stirring over medium high heat. In a small bowl mix flour and butter together. Add the flour mixture into the pot, continue to stir until it thickens.

Add in drained vegetables, corn, remaining 3 cups of chicken broth, bouillon cubes, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. Continue stirring for a couple minutes until well combined.

Serve in bowls and enjoy with a dinner roll or some cornbread.
