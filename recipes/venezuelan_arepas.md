Venezuelan Arepas (not to be confused with Colombian Arepas) are a typical venezuelan dish.
They can be filled with dozens of things, and each presentation has a particular name, but they're still arepas.

- ⏲️ Prep time: 10 min
- 🍳 Cook time: 5 min
- 🍽️ Servings: 3-4

## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups of water
- 2 cups of precooked corn flour
- protien to taste

## Directions

1. Combine the water, the precooked corn flour, and a little bit of salt in a large mixing bowl.
2. Mix the ingredients by hand until no clumps remain in the resulting dough and it has a smooth but solid consistency.
*Tip: Mix the water and salt first and then taste the water for salinity before adding the flour.
*Tip: Let the dough sit for a few minutes. THe consistency of the dough should not be super firm.
3. Preheat a pan with oil over low heat.
4. Take a piece of dough and form a ball the size of the palm of your hand.
*Tip: Keeping your hands wet will help with the dough not sticking too much to your hand.
5. Carefully slap the ball side by side to make a disk neither too thick nor too thin.
6. Repeat the process with the remainder of the dough.
7. Put the arepas in the preheated pan and wait for it approximately 2 minutes and a half to flip it over.
*Tip: You can know they are ready if they are slightly inflated and the outside has formed a hard shell. Can sometimes take up to 10 minutes on each side!
8. When both sides are cooked, take them out of the pan.
9. Cut through the middle of the arepas with a butter knife, and brush them with butter.
10. Fill them with protein to taste (vegetables and cheese)
